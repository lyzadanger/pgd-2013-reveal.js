					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">I started integrating PhoneGap into my vision of a pan-device universe with standardized web components at its core. Built with standards-based web applications consuming data from APIs, with extensive commonality yet still comfortable on each specific platform, retaining the comfortable and <em>quick</em> web developer workflow, primarily in the browser, and with an end product that runs in the browser <em>as well as</em> on targeted platforms.</aside>

					<h5>PhoneGap Self-defense for those of us who think like the web</h5>

					  <h2>Where we go wrong</h2>
					  <aside class="notes">If you are a web developer about to make your first forays into PhoneGap, here are some areas you may want to wear some extra padding.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Core Web Concepts</h3>
						<p>Adherence to certain core web <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">concepts</span> can get us in trouble. Some things we have long held to be Absolutely The Way are different in the app world, subtlely or extremely.</p>
						<aside class="notes">We have certain patterns of thinking about the way the web works as a whole, about the way that Web standards work together. These patterns are often skewed in the native application context.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Nuance and Best Practices</h3>
						<p>Like it or not, we're <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">on device</span> in a <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">native context</span>.</p>
						<aside class="notes">As web developers, tend to fight platform specificity. It's in our nature. But we <em>are</em> in a native context. And because of that, we're beholden to certain patterns that will be new to us.</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Process, Components and Tools</h3>
						<p>Suddenly, your workflow matters. A trusty <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">text editor isn't enough</span> anymore, there's tons of <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">tedious detail</span> <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">you need to deal with</span>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">I'm somewhat irrationally proud of my "have text editor, will travel", environment-free way of developing and that no longer really cuts it. Suddenly I have to buckle down and deal with config-level tedium that does not generally appeal to me as a web dev. But giving it short shrift can be fatal.</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-background="assets/storm.jpg">
						<h3>Complexity</h3>
						<p>And these problems <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">compound</span> as your app grows.</p>
						<aside class="notes">It's self-evident that these concerns would get more complex as your app grows. So I urge you to get out in front of things beforehand.</aside>

							<li class="fragment">I'm not smart enough to tackle it myself, so I use things like <code><a href="https://github.com/lucian1900/Backbone.dualStorage">backbone.dualStorage</a></code></li>

						<h3>Wrangling Data: Offline Mode</h3>
						<p>Finally a bit of good news: build your data wrangling carefully, and offline mode can follow naturally.</p>
						<p class="fragment">WRT PhoneGap proper, If you want a bit more control:</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code data-trim contenteditable>
// Hold that thought
document.addEventListener("offline", nobodyIsAnswering, false);
