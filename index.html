					<aside class="notes">I started integrating PhoneGap into my vision of a pan-device universe with standardized web components at its core. Built with standards-based web applications consuming data from APIs, with extensive commonality yet still comfortable on each specific platform, retaining the comfortable and <em>quick</em> web developer workflow, primarily in the browser, and with an end product that runs in the browser <em>as well as</em> on targeted platforms.</aside>

					<h1>A bit of self-defense</h1>
					<h5>PhoneGap Self-defense for those of us who think like the web</h5>
					<aside class="notes">A few places where I endured a large number of body blows, and thus a few areas you may wish to wear some extra padding as you make forays as a web developer into the app world with PhoneGap.</aside>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Core Web Concepts</h3>
						<p>Adherence to certain core web <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">concepts</span> can get us in trouble. Some things we have long held to be Absolutely The Way are different in the app world, subtlely or extremely.</p>
						<aside class="notes">We have certain patterns of thinking about the way the web works as a whole. I'm not talking about web <em>standards</em>, I'm talking about web <em>concepts</em>.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Nuance and Best Practices</h3>
						<p>Like it or not, we're <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">on device</span> in a <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">native context</span>.</p>
						<aside class="notes">As web developers, tend to fight platform specificity. It's in our nature. Or more than likely a <em>specific</em> device or devices. And because of that, we're beholden to certain patterns that will be new to us.</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Process, Components and Tools</h3>
						<p>Suddenly, your workflow matters. A trusty <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">text editor isn't enough</span> anymore, there's tons of <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">tedious detail</span> <span class="fragment highlight-cloudfour">you need to deal with</span>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">I'm somewhat irrationally proud of my "have text editor, will travel", environment-free way of developing and that no longer really cuts it. Suddenly I have to buckle down and deal with config-level minutiae that do not generally appeal to me as a web dev. But giving it short shrift can be fatal.</aside>
